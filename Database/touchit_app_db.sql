It doesn t stop at that and goes ahead to give you an idea of the types of errors you are most likely to commit and how to avoid them. The most interesting part is the section where it guides you back to the relevant page and section from your NCERT Book for further revision.\n\nThe tests are constructed as per CBSE Sample papers and the latest blueprints released by CBSE. The question papers are of 3 Levels: Easy, Medium and Hard. It is recommended that a student should start with the easy level and progress to the next level. The Math & Science test series would replace the need for sample papers, model papers, or test papers the student subscribes to for CBSE exam Preparation.\n\nObjective Tests can be taken on app itself. Each test is according to the guidelines given by the CBSE. Once you submit a test, a report is generated along with Question-wise Analysis that shows you the answer key of the test . The report guides you about the weak areas that need to taken care of.\n\nFor Subjective Test, you just need to download the question paper of the test you would like to take. You can also get the question paper right in your inbox which you can print as well. You need to attempt the subjective tests on normal sheets. Once finished, just click the images of your answer sheets and upload them on the app. You will get the solutions on the app for analysis.\n\nThe Customized Report is generated once you have taken both Objective and Subjective Test of the same chapter.

Are you bored of your NCERT 8 class science book? Or\n\nDoes Maths intimidate you? Does the idea of algebraic expressions make you want to run far far away?\n\nThen use the MarkSharks Class 8 learning app and start learning in a 21st century way – when you learn for fun, you learn for life!\n\nResearch shows that “learning by doing” is the best way to learn. In learning by doing, students construct knowledge by experiencing and exploring their environment. MarkSharks is a revolutionary app that teaches CBSE 8 class Science & Maths through games, simulations, virtual experiments, 3-D models and interactive exercises. We have harnessed the power of mobile devices to enable true “learning by doing” – we deconstruct the NCERT textbook curriculum and transform it into fun, engaging modules for class 8!\n\nWhen children truly understand concepts and principles, they don t need to spend hours memorizing facts and formulas. This understanding of concepts also makes HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills) questions easy to solve. And because they are learning on their own device, they can learn at a pace that suits them. As a result, not only is learning on MarkSharks fun and engaging, it is highly effective too, allowing our users to earn better marks through better learning.\n\nWhat MarkSharks is NOT:\n\n- This is NOT a collection of CBSE question papers/ CBSE sample papers/ solves sample papers: Merely taking tests is NOT enough. We believe that conceptual clarity is key!\n\n- This is NOT just a pdf of eighth class science textbook/ NCERT 8 class science book/ CBSE 8th class science book: Books are boring and NOT effective for all types of learners. Learning should be fun, immersive, interactive and self-paced!\n\nThe MarkSharks Class 8 app is mapped 100% to the CBSE class 8 syllabus – our app covers content from all the chapters currently found in class 8 science NCERT book, which are:\n\n1. Crop production and management\n2. Microorganisms: Friend and foe\n3. Synthetic fibres and plastics\n4. Metals and non-metals\n5. Coal and petroleum\n6. Combustion and flame\n7. Conservation of plants and animals\n8. Cell: Structure and functions\n9. Reproduction in animals\n10. Reaching the age of adolescence\n11. Force and pressure\n12. Friction\n13. Sound\n14. Chemical effects of electric current\n15. Some natural phenomena\n16. Light\n17. Stars and the solar system\n18. Pollution of air and water\n\nThe Maths module in our app covers content from all class 8 topics found in the NCERT book, which are:\n\n01 - Rational Numbers\n02 - Linear Equations in One Variable\n03 - Understanding Quadrilaterals\n04 - Practical Geometry\n05 - Data Handling\n06 - Squares and Square Roots\n07 - Cubes and Cube Roots\n08 - Comparing Quantities\n09 - Algebraic Expressions and Identities\n10 - Visualising Solid Shapes\n11 - Mensuration\n12 - Exponents and Powers\n13 - Direct and Inverse Proportions\n14 - Factorisation\n15 - Introduction to Graphs\n16 - Playing With Numbers\n\nWe will continue to add new features and subjects to MarkSharks so that students not only can learn on their own, at their own pace and in their own time, but can also share their learnings with friends via our “social learning” environment and access to tutors online to help clear problems. Parents will get online access to track their child s performance on MarkSharks and compare it with other students who are studying on the system.\n\nWhen it comes to Class 8 Maths & Science , practice makes perfect and MarkSharks allows just that. Not only does MarkSharks allow students to practice, it encourages them to have fun which they study their Maths & Science class 8 curriculum. With interactive exercises and simulations, class 8 Maths & Science has never been more interesting!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/class-8-maths-and-science/com.oksedu.marksharks.cbse.g08.s02/download?from=home', '4.0.0.7', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FLAm5iorPPJbyOIR2YV-6pzt2rV4XgTOb0tRknSdgA1l0nKfycY3OMq2i6SEK4g67A=w72', 0, 4, 2232, 100, '2017-01-29 16:05:17', 'com.oksedu.marksharks.cbse.g08.s02', 0),

All types of games may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are games that are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.\n\nGame based learning (GBL) is a type of game play that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain and apply said subject matter to the real world.\n\nEducational entertainment (also referred to by the portmanteau "edutainment", which is education + entertainment) is any entertainment content that is designed to educate as well as to entertain. Content with a high degree of both educational and entertainment value is known as edutainment. There also exists content that is primarily educational but has incidental entertainment value. Finally, there is content that is mostly entertaining but can be seen to have some educational value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/educational-games-for-kids/com.zodinplex.abc.kids.letters.educational.sounds.baby/download?from=home', '1.23', 'https://lh6.ggpht.com/YN4QuSmKBKdvlGpg0i0_Is-AU2At0h5EnAGmf_8WRcMy_1EewW_j4bfloQ9xUsQkwis=w72', 0, 4, 26908, 1, '2017-01-29 16:24:58', 'com.zodinplex.abc.kids.letters.educational.sounds.baby', 0),

Join Bud on a journey through his house, school, city and around as he and his friends go from place to place to learn and review everyday sight words used in English for naming things. There is a long list of vocabulary for the children to learn and practice.\n\nIn Bud s First Words - Reading Games, toddlers and preschool kids will start learning by listening and reading nouns, the names of things found around them in everyday places like bedroom, bathroom, classroom, playground, park, etc. Then in Play mode children will read questions and they will be asked to identify the same objects and recognize their words to reinforce their learning. In no time you will see kids spotting and naming things around the house and increasing their vocabulary every time they play. \n\nAlong with the Common Core goals (described below), the aim of Words for Kids is to:\n\n- improve reading skills by practicing words children hear at home and school\n- improve reading fluency\n- boost kids confidence and self esteem\n- help children with difficulties like autism, add, adhd, speech delay, non-verbal in reading and learning English language and communication in a positive and stimulating way. \n\nActivities in this game are based on the following Common Core State Standards:\n\n+ CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.1.A\nPrint many upper- and lowercase letters.\n\n+ CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.1.B\nUse frequently occurring nouns and verbs.\n\n+ CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.1.D\nUnderstand and use question words (interrogatives) (e.g., who, what, where, when, why, how).\n\n+ CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.2.D\nSpell simple words phonetically, drawing on knowledge of sound-letter relationships.\n\n+ CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.5.A\nSort common objects into categories to gain a sense of the concepts the categories represent.\n\n+CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.5.C\nIdentify real-life connections between words and their use.\n\n+ CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.2\nDemonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes).\n\n\nBud s First Words - Reading Games is the first app in our collection of English learning games with a focus on vocabulary. Next to Bud s First Words - Reading Games is our latest app Bud s Rhyming words - Reading Games, which focuses on word families, rhymes and vocabulary through 3 amazingly adventurous games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/words-for-kids---reading-games/com.nimbleminds.everydaywordsfree/download?from=home', '2.0', 'https://lh4.ggpht.com/pLsoIlyxwr0L1xyZzn4ud25SQQY2SFJUUfEjt2Zn6pNCFAn2HpF_-A9unMg0GJitoNk=w72', 0, 4, 6948, 1, '2017-01-29 16:32:54', 'com.nimbleminds.everydaywordsfree', 0),

You need E-walk or E-walk Free to use this plugin:\n\n• E-walk : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.at.ewalk.pro\n• E-walk Free : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id= com.at.ewalk.free\n\nThe plugin adds to E-walk the ability to use the IGN maps, and the IGN Leisure Space.\n\nWARNING: these features mostly cover France only.\n\nIGN MAPS\n\nThe IGN maps are highly detailed and cover the totality of french territory. Some maps are only available at certain zoom levels. They are the same as the ones used on the Géoportail website (http://www.geoportail.gouv.fr).\n\nThe IGN maps plugin adds to E-walk 8 base maps :\n\n• ortho images: a high resolution satellite imagery (zoom levels 2 - 19)\n• scan: a scan of paper IGN maps (zoom levels 2 - 18)\n• scan express (classic): a scan of paper IGN maps often updated but with less details (zoom levels 6 - 18)\n• scan express (standard): a scan of paper IGN maps often updated but with less details, with another style (zoom levels 6 - 18)\n• ICAO maps: International Civil Aviation Organisation maps (zoom levels 6 - 11)\n• administratives limits: administratives limits map (zoom levels 6 - 10)\n• elevation map: digital terrain model (zoom levels 6 - 14)\n• army staff map (1820-1866): historical map from 18th century (zoom levels 6 - 15)\n\nAnd 8 overlay maps:\n\n• cadastral parcels (black): map of numerical cadastral information (zoom levels 2 - 20)\n• cadastral parcels (white): map of numerical cadastral information (zoom levels 2 - 20)\n• cadastral parcels (orange): map of numerical cadastral information (zoom levels 2 - 20)\n• administrative limits: map of administrative limits (zoom levels 6 - 18)\n• buildings: map of constructions (zoom levels 12 - 18)\n• geographical names: map showing names of cities, towns, etc... (zoom levels 12 - 18)\n• Histolitt coastline: map showing the limit between land and marine area (zoom levels 6 - 18)\n• hydrography: map of lakes, reservoirs, rivers, creeks, etc... (zoom levels 6 - 18)\n\nLICENCES\n\nThe plugin allows to see the maps through two licences: Discovery licence (free), and Adventure licence (5.99$USD / month or 14.99$USD / year). The Discovery licence is limited by a monthly quota shared between all the users. Once the quota is exceeded, the maps can t be displayed until the next month.\n\nThe plugin also propose an offline option (9.99$USD / year), which allows you to download the maps beforehand on your device, in order to use them without any internet access.\n\nIGN LEISURE SPACE\n\nThe IGN Leisure Space (http://espaceloisirs.ign.fr) is a website provided by the IGN, allowing you to visualize treks and points of interest among the tens of thousands available. You can also add and share yours. Those treks and points of interest are mostly available in France only.\n\nWith E-walk, you can synchronize the treks and points of interest that you like on your device. Thereby, they will be available anywhere, and you ll no longer need an internet access to see them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/ign-maps-(e-walk-plugin)/com.at.ewalk.plugin.ign/download?from=home', '1.0.3', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BSfvgPu2mzReGSQ6bWurQ7Bamb6dth5DRxZ72CU-W2N_DdEWR6I4ZY6TBsSAqAtsbP8=w72', 0, 4, 12, 5, '2017-01-30 06:23:11', 'com.at.ewalk.plugin.ign', 0),

Geo Area is born in the agriculture fields, in Urban Planning sessions, and in remote sensing projects. It is designed to cater for just about anyone s needs to measure field areas, collect ground samples, GIS surveys, and measuring perimeter shareable on all GIS platforms. \nWHAT MAKES GEO AREA UNIQUE?\n\n- Highly accurate area measurement, verified and tested with ground data\n- Multiple area and perimeter units\n- Ability to generate KML files\n- Sharing KML for visualization on any GIS \n- Ability to edit, delete records\n- User friendly\n- Intuitive interface based on latest Android Material design\n- Tap the map to mark area, OR\n- Use the phone GPS receiver\n- Ability to pause, start and stop GPS mode so that you can easily select the desired points\n- Unlike our competitor Apps, Geo Area has NO RESTRICTIONS ON SHARING your data\n- Not just an area calculator, its much more\n\n\nACCURACY TEST EXAMPLE:\n\nOne of the screenshots shows Google Tennis Courts at (1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy,Mountain View, CA 94043) - check this yourself to see how accurately Geo Area works:\n\nTennis court dimensions are: 36 ft(10.97m) x 78 ft(23.78m)\nTherefore, Area= 36 ft(10.97m) x 78 ft(23.78m)=2808 square feet(260.8666 square metres)\nPerimeter = Sum of all four sides=228 ft (69.5m)\n\nYou can change units from the application settings from feet to meters OR to acres OR to hectares OR to kanals OR to kilometers. Your choice!\n\n\nGEO AREA LETS YOU DO THE FOLLOWING:\n\n1. Measure the area and perimeter of just about anything on the ground as seen on Google Maps\n2. Use area and perimeter units of your choice including feet, meter, hectare, Kanal (area units for India), kilometer, yards, and acre.\n3. Either tap on the points of interest on the Google Maps to mark area, OR\n4. Use the phone s GPS to mark the field boundary\n5. Create Categories of your choice where you can group fields,please refer to the screenshots \n6. Create unlimited categories\n7. Geo Area lets you share and see the marked fields on any GIS for instance the Google Earth\n\n\nGEO AREA is for:\n\n1. Land based surveys\n2. Farmers, for farm management\n3. Land record management\n4. Construction surveys\n5. Agronomists\n6. Town planners\n7. Construction surveyor \n8. GIS data collection\n9. Health, Education and facilities mapping\n10. Farm fencing\n11. Sports track measurement\n12. Construction sites and building sites area\n13. Asset mapping\n14. Landscape artists\n15. Landscape design\n\nGeo Area is used by farmers for several agricultural applications: crop yield estimation, crop area measurement, and agriculture yield. Geo Area has been used in conjunction with remote sensing (satellite imagery e.g. SPOT 6, SPOT 7) and GIS applications, to collect ground truth data, field records, crop yield, farmers data and agriculture output. Geo Area is ideal for land cover analysis, vegetation mapping and remote sensing where Regions of interests (ROIs) or the Points of Interest (POIs) or Area of Interest (AOI) collected through Geo Area. As seen in the example, Geo Area is ideal for area measurement (area calculator) and perimeter of sports grounds, cricket grounds, football pitches, tennis courts, badminton courts, parking lot area, residential space, running track and rental space. Several other applications exist e.g. transforming manual Patwari or Patvari and the old tape measure system for land record management. \n\nGeo Area is customizeable for all crops including cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, sugar beet, maize, tobacco, Virginia, FCV tobacco, vegetables, banana plantations, dates and orchards mapping. Geo Area has also been used for forest mapping and GPS based measurement of deforestation area. Geo Area has also been used to estimate fertilizers, chemical spray, insecticides required for agricultural fields based on the calculated area.\n\nNothing is complete in itself - we are learning from YOU to make Geo Area more useful.

It takes a simple, unadulterated view of the world to provoke thought, arouse awareness and restore old stories and traditions in a whole new way. Issue 1-2014: Welcome to a brand new year with Asian Geographic JUNIOR! I am so pleased we are kicking of f the year with one of my favourite themes of all time – Great Asian Journeys. In fact, as I was putting the magazine together last year, I was embarking on an epic journey myself – sailing across the Pacific Ocean (the world s largest) on a boat from the Philippines to Palau and not before stopping\n\nIssue 6-2013: We ve come to the end of the year and what better way to end a great year than to take a look into the past and see how it has impacted the present. I think this will be a great read to do with your parents because it will definitely awake some wonder ful memories from their own childhoods. I would also like to take this oppor tunity to thank you for your suppor t and hope you will continue\n\nIssue 5-2013: Be prepared for some eye-popping stories in this edition with images and articles that are a feast for the eyes! We find out how powerful colour can be and yet is so abstract scientists believe it is a figment of our imaginations! Grab your copy today to find out more! \n\nIssue 4-2013: I hope you had a fun time during the holidays and back at school, refreshed and ready to star t your new term. In this issue, we look at the stuf f we throw away. We will track where it goes, what can be done with it and how we can minimise the way we dump our trash to help the environment. I d also like you to read about some children who are not as lucky as you on page 42 in the Thinking Caps \n\nIssue 3-2013: he first half of the year is almost over and I am sure a lot of you are get ting excited about the upcoming holidays. But that means you ll first have to get through the mid-year exams, so I hope this issue will inspire you to work hard when you read about the many treasures we have in Asia. These treasures are not just about precious stones and gems, they also include things and places\n\nIssue 2-2013: This issue is meant to make you cringe, your tummy turn and to make you go ‘ewww  and ‘yuck ! But I m sure this will be a fun read and a real page-turner where you can find out what being in a microscopic world is like, how you can make your own slime and find out the queer (and gross) habits of some animals. \n\nIssue 1, 2013: Welcome to a brand new year! I ve received many letters in the past year telling me how much you all love animals. So the team has dedicated a whole issue to them! It was a lot of fun and I learnt a lot putting the magazine together. Actually, the lesser-known animals were ver y intriguing and I ended up reading and researching more about them. \n\nIssue 6, 2012: My goodness, how time flies! I hope you have all had a great year having adventures, spending quality time with your families and making a dif ference for other people, no matter how small. In this last issue for 2012, the team chose Bridges as a theme because today, we can t imagine a world without them. These physical connectors have gone beyond just getting us from one place to another. \n\nIssue 5 2012: Here s another exciting issue dealing with subjects we don t normally talk about but totally necessar y! It s about life as we know it so far, and how we are all inter-connected in a complex, intricate web of relationships. Ever ything we do has a consequence and we can create an impact that will easily cause a chain reaction in the entire animal and plant kingdom!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/asian-geographic-junior/com.magzter.asiangeographicjunior/download?from=home', '5.2', 'https://lh5.ggpht.com/_QuSBJC51k6iJl-Ga2J7SueZQl9-6m8KhLiq4Yu_5pGyEahfi8744A5T6t9CXWDtDVo=w72', 0, 4, 3, 100, '2017-01-30 06:24:54', 'com.magzter.asiangeographicjunior', 0),

This game is going to be particularly interesting for people who enjoy geography and travelling as well as participating in other intellectual games and solving puzzles of the same type. It is a good opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge in front of your friends or check the bag of knowledge of your friend or buddy. In this game, you have to collect the names of various countries out of 14 chaotically scattered letters, which appear on the screen of your mobile phone or tablet. In order for you to guess the country, a flag and territory contour will be shown on the political map. In total, there are 50 levels of the game, and we will add more levels in the future time. \n\nCheck and improve your geography knowledge - it is a great way to spend your time with fun and benefit! This exciting game is perfect for children of preschool and school ages as soon as it provides kids with lots of new information, which is going to be helpful during geography lessons. \n\nIf you cannot pass the level, you can use two types of hints. The first one is a bomb, which you can «explode» and thus get rid off all the extra letters that do not compose the country s name. The second hint allows you to see one of the letters of a hidden word. We do recommend you not to hurry to use all the hints given, because you cannot use them several times in a row. A «bomb» hint takes 24 hours to recover and «see the hidden letter» - 12 hours. \n\nIf you run out of hints and struggling to get to another level, you can always ask your friends for help in social networks right on the game.\n\nIf you love games, quizzes and geography tests, you will definitely like this application! Overall, if you want to learn how to recognize flags of any country in the world, this is a game for you!

Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up here: http://www.gsmarena.com/ \n\nTry calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described here \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI.\nAre there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass? Try switching off "magnetic correction" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.\n\nWhy is autolocation not supported for my phone?\nIn Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described here:\nhttps://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m\n\nThe Map is jittery\nTry adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings).

TOEFL Vocabulary Practice is the app that covers the most important words used for the real TOEFL test exam. The list of words were carefully selected by language experts and if these are mastered, chances of a successful TOEFL test pass are very high. Each of the 650+ TOEFL vocabulary comes with full definition, sample usage, phonetic/sound pronunciation and much more details as included in the Oxford dictionary. You can learn these words and take language tests to see how well you understand them. You ll learn words faster as this TOEFL practice app uses different types of quizzes to make learning interactive. It includes TOEFL listening exercises, helps you with TOEFL reading practice, TOEFL writing and TOEFL speaking.\n\nMain Features:\n?TOEFL Vocabulary with 650+ Words. This app has a vocabulary with 650+ words used in the TOEIC test. These are neatly divided in 12 different categories that span every important domain (i.e. Psychology, History, Environment, Linguistics, ...). Each category will show you how many words it contains and you can tap to see the list of words & start learning those.\n? Easily Learn the Words. Each word in the TOEFL dictionary can be easily learned. Tap on each word to listen how it is pronounced and also read a detailed description. Once you re ready to start learning it, you will need to type it 4 times. The first 3 times you ll have suggestions (auto-complete), but the last time you ll need to type it in correctly to be marked as learned.\n? Test your Vocabulary. For an effective study you will need to test the newly learned words. There are 4 different types of tests you can take: type/choose a word based on the presented description, pick a description that matches a word, use scrambled letters to create a word based on a description and lastly listen and type the word. These tests simulate partially the real TOEFL test.\n? Word Training. You can also train for a set of words to see how well you master them. The difference between training and testing is that during training you won t be "penalized" if you get some wrong answers. This allows you to practice words for the real TOEFL exam without any pressure.\n? Daily New Words. The only way to truly learn is persistence! The app helps you learn every day by teaching you some new words. It will also show a push notification to remind you that it is time to study. You can change the number of daily new words show in the app settings. For extra help you can enable an online spell-checker to verify words as you type them.\n? Random Test. Every now and then (randomly) the app will ask some questions to check your vocabulary knowledge. These random language tests are a great quick study method to remember what you learned.\n\nTOEFL Vocabulary Practice is an essential app for those that want to pass the TOEFL test. It also allows you to customize the definitions for vocabulary words by choosing a main one out of the existing definitions. This TOEFL practice makes perfection thus a daily intake of vocabulary words will help you learn faster and be prepared for the final exam.\n\nWith the help of this educational app you can fine-tune your TOEFL listening and reading skills or advance from starter to English language expert. We are committed to help you learn & prepare for a TOEFL exam thus any feedback is appreciated in the comments below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/toefl-vocabulary-practice-ibt/com.english.toefl.learnword/download?from=home', '2.8', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O2guylY1NQiZAj57VBeEvylHfyirpNNtWMYPPcUMg30-xKpfuSmSpfacPHobjW78GSUa=w72', 0, 4, 366, 50, '2017-01-30 06:49:05', 'com.english.toefl.learnword', 0),

Learn Spanish (Español) with SpeakTribe. Learn Spanish with fun, interactive lessons. Even beginners will find it easy to learn Spanish (Español).\n\nOur users say this about us - \n\n- "...fastest way to learn Spanish. Explains everything in details, and not just skim through them like other apps. Couldn t recommend this more!"\n- "Best language learning app I ve tried...If you want to learn how to speak Spanish, this is it!"\n- "The app is so interactive, it s like you have a teacher right in your hands teaching you to speak Spanish!"\n\nA mix of lessons teaches you vocabulary and grammar, along with conversation practice for real-world situations. This amazing mix of lessons makes this app the fastest way to get started with Spanish. You will get the hang of basic conversational Spanish in as little as 5 days!\n\nAs one of our delighted users says, it is like you have a personal teacher in your hands. Teaching you Spanish words, different grammar rules, explaining confusing concepts AND opportunities throughout the course to speak Spanish with your virtual friend. And the personal teacher helps you to learn Spanish when you want, where you want, at the pace you want to.\n\nUsing SpeakTribe you learn how to speak Spanish and test for it at the same time by playing a game. You will start speaking by learning words, short phrases, and sentences in just 5 days. SpeakTribe, your personal coach, will help you learn basics including vocabulary and pronunciation in a fun and easy way.\n\nThe design of the course is based on scientific research which tells that, to understand basics of a language you need not master a large vocabulary. SpeakTribe introduces you to the more common words and phrases first, so that by the end of first day itself you can form your own basic sentences which are not just academic but also practical. \n\nThere are many other guiding principles behind the design -\n* Language is primarily vocal - SpeakTribe emphasizes on listening and speaking more than anything else, the two faculties which are also the most useful to a new learner.\n* You need to practice a language to master it and gain confidence. And so, SpeakTribe provides you ability to chat (speak) with the application.\n* Any language has a small number of prepositions and conjunctions, some of which take some time to master but are crucial to your understanding of the language.\n* Noun words constitute the majority of a mature vocabulary but they do not give you the best ROI initially in terms understanding a language. Once you have a solid foundation built, you will find picking up these words pretty easy.\n* Verbs are the most useful but the most difficult set to master. \n\nSo go ahead, give it a shot, and learn Spanish - one of the most popular languages of the world! You will find it was actually fun to learn Spanish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/learn-spanish-with-speaktribe/com.speaktribe.spanish/download?from=home', '', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0nqwlKasP4ftS2jI7ghvu54wFv81ceal5-QCcqBD6DWQ__beptw51B-a_PcwtAelKvE=w72', 0, 5, 39638, 1, '2017-01-30 06:51:35', 'com.speaktribe.spanish', 0),

You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Russian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that s opposite to the average language course.\n\nThis is how the future of language courses looks like\nThe App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It s an effective way to learn Russian phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\nCrystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right Russian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\nState-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Russian words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Russian clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\nUseful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Russian. Mondly teaches you Russian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\nLearn conversational Russian. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Russian vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Russian clearly.\n\nVerb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Russian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\nAdvanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\nThe Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nAdaptive Learning. Learning Russian is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Russian lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/learn-russian.-speak-russian/com.atistudios.italk.ru/download?from=home', 'Varies with device', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iI-wrhZmplcdBE_pw205NsV592GmLrK0kY-PpJlFKEpCHL8uN6oetvLrIVdFkUcsczg=w72', 0, 5, 15682, 100, '2017-01-30 06:54:52', 'com.atistudios.italk.ru', 0),

It will introduce the amazing colors of our world to your baby, with the educational process being funny and excessively interesting. With no effort, toddlers will learn to name colors, and to associate them with different objects like fruits and animals. \n\nAdvantages of the Game:\n- The game will easily teach your child nine various colors: red, pink, gray, brown, purple, blue, green, yellow and orange one. Each color comes along with three bright funny pictures matching the shade.\n\n- The colors and the pictures are named in three languages: English, French, and Spanish. This allows the kid to learn over 30 foreign words, which will be very useful for the further study of the languages. Each word is pronounced clearly and distinctly. \n\n- A fascinating mosaic mini-game behind the “Play” door will help to reinforce the newly acquired skills and to train the child s memory. The funny squeaking little mouse peeping out of the hole in the corner of the room every once and while brights up the game.\n\n- The game interface is very simple and intuitive. Even the youngest children will be able to play it on their own.\n\nHow to Play:\n\n- Learn your colors. The “Learn” door is for learning colors. After you open it, you ll be showed a certain color, along with its name being pronounced. Then, one-by-one, the game reveals three illustrative pictures to match the colour. For example, Lemon, Sun, and Chicken illustrate the yellow paint. The child will be amused by the bright cartoonish pictures that make the educational process highly entertaining.\n\n- Learn foreign words. When the three pictures appear on the screen, the names of the objects, fruits or animals in them are also pronounced. Touch any of the pictures to hear its pronunciation again. Use the button in the upper left corner of the main screen to change the language.\n\n- Test your knowledge. The “Play” door is for the mini-game. Come in to check the color recognition skills of your toddler and to revise the names of the colors. The child has to match each of the three painted canvas to the frame of similar color. If the pieces are drawn together correctly, the child will hear a word of praise. \n\nSmall kids often have troubles identifying and naming colors. The game allows the preschooler not only to learn his or her colors, but also to correlate them with different objects. It is very important for children 3 years old and under to notice the visual differences between colors. The best way to help them remember the new information is through playing games and using bright pictures. A great idea for parents would be to speak out the color of the object seen on the screen. For example, say, “Gray, the mouse is gray, can you say gray?” Then later ask, “What color is the mouse?” You can also do this exercise vice versa: ask your child to look at the three pictures and name their color. \n\nThe game offers three illustrative pictures for each color. But you can add on by asking your kid to name a few more objects of similar color. Such training can contribute to the cognitive development of your child by improving his or her memory and logical thinking. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/learning-colors-for-kids/com.oki.colors/download?from=home', '', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ESvBniXVHrornwZoAn2yHD_ACxawareCprtbTDF520yP91fSWNaI5Y-Bepz6RiJARueu=w72', 0, 4, 29020, 10, '2017-01-30 06:55:34', 'com.oki.colors', 0),

However, much like the fingers of your hands, the four are not equal in effectiveness for learning – reading is the most potent tool for learning.\n\nThe best way to learn something is to read about it, followed by ‘seeing, listening and doing  around it; any other way to learn e.g. hearing a lecture in class followed by a video and activities, is a less-effective way to learn.\n\nThe trouble is that learning to read is outside the original, genetic capability of the human brain and reading is a totally acquired skill.

Are you bored of your NCERT 8 class science book? Or\n\nDoes Maths intimidate you? Does the idea of algebraic expressions make you want to run far far away?\n\nThen use the MarkSharks Class 8 learning app and start learning in a 21st century way – when you learn for fun, you learn for life!\n\nResearch shows that “learning by doing” is the best way to learn. In learning by doing, students construct knowledge by experiencing and exploring their environment. MarkSharks is a revolutionary app that teaches CBSE 8 class Science & Maths through games, simulations, virtual experiments, 3-D models and interactive exercises. We have harnessed the power of mobile devices to enable true “learning by doing” – we deconstruct the NCERT textbook curriculum and transform it into fun, engaging modules for class 8!\n\nWhen children truly understand concepts and principles, they don t need to spend hours memorizing facts and formulas. This understanding of concepts also makes HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills) questions easy to solve. And because they are learning on their own device, they can learn at a pace that suits them. As a result, not only is learning on MarkSharks fun and engaging, it is highly effective too, allowing our users to earn better marks through better learning.\n\nWhat MarkSharks is NOT:\n\n- This is NOT a collection of CBSE question papers/ CBSE sample papers/ solves sample papers: Merely taking tests is NOT enough. We believe that conceptual clarity is key!\n\n- This is NOT just a pdf of eighth class science textbook/ NCERT 8 class science book/ CBSE 8th class science book: Books are boring and NOT effective for all types of learners. Learning should be fun, immersive, interactive and self-paced!\n\nThe MarkSharks Class 8 app is mapped 100% to the CBSE class 8 syllabus – our app covers content from all the chapters currently found in class 8 science NCERT book, which are:\n\n1. Crop production and management\n2. Microorganisms: Friend and foe\n3. Synthetic fibres and plastics\n4. Metals and non-metals\n5. Coal and petroleum\n6. Combustion and flame\n7. Conservation of plants and animals\n8. Cell: Structure and functions\n9. Reproduction in animals\n10. Reaching the age of adolescence\n11. Force and pressure\n12. Friction\n13. Sound\n14. Chemical effects of electric current\n15. Some natural phenomena\n16. Light\n17. Stars and the solar system\n18. Pollution of air and water\n\nThe Maths module in our app covers content from all class 8 topics found in the NCERT book, which are:\n\n01 - Rational Numbers\n02 - Linear Equations in One Variable\n03 - Understanding Quadrilaterals\n04 - Practical Geometry\n05 - Data Handling\n06 - Squares and Square Roots\n07 - Cubes and Cube Roots\n08 - Comparing Quantities\n09 - Algebraic Expressions and Identities\n10 - Visualising Solid Shapes\n11 - Mensuration\n12 - Exponents and Powers\n13 - Direct and Inverse Proportions\n14 - Factorisation\n15 - Introduction to Graphs\n16 - Playing With Numbers\n\nWe will continue to add new features and subjects to MarkSharks so that students not only can learn on their own, at their own pace and in their own time, but can also share their learnings with friends via our “social learning” environment and access to tutors online to help clear problems. Parents will get online access to track their child s performance on MarkSharks and compare it with other students who are studying on the system.\n\nWhen it comes to Class 8 Maths & Science , practice makes perfect and MarkSharks allows just that.

Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?\nAre you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you! Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\n\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\n\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.\n\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\n\nGet more from Twilight\n1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading. Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen\n\n2) AMOLED screens: We have tested Twilight on an AMOLED screen for 2.5 years without any sign of depletion or over-burning. If properly configured Twilight causes less light emission (by enabling dimming) with more equal light distribution (dark areas of the screen such as the status bar get tinted). This may in fact increase your AMOLED screen life time.\n\nBasics on circadian rhythm and the role of melatonin\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanopsin\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythms\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_disorder\n\nPermissions\n- location - to find out your current sunset/surise times\n- running apps - to stop Twilight in selected apps\n- write settings - to set back-light\n- network - access smartlight (Philips HUE) to shield you household light from blue\n\nAutomation (Tasker or other)\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/twilight4android/automation\n\nRelated scientific research\n\nAmplitude Reduction and Phase Shifts of Melatonin, Cortisol and Other Circadian Rhythms after a Gradual Advance of Sleep and Light Exposure in Humans Derk-Jan Dijk, & Co 2012\n\nExposure to Room Light before Bedtime Suppresses Melatonin Onset and Shortens Melatonin Duration in Humans Joshua J.

Are you bored of your NCERT class 9 science book? Use our CBSE app and start learning in a 21st century way – when you learn for fun, you learn for life!

We believe that conceptual clarity is key!\nThis is NOT just a pdf of 9th standard science textbook/ NCERT 9 class science book/ CBSE 9th class science book.\nWhat MarkSharks is:\n\nMarkSharks CBSE IX science app is currently mapped to the CBSE science class 9 book and syllabus – our app covers content from all class 9 physics, class 9 chemistry and class 9 biology topics found in the NCERT book, which are:\n\n1. Matter in our Surroundings\n2. Is Matter Around us Pure?\n3. Atoms and Molecules\n4. Structure of the Atom\n5. The Fundamental Unit of Life\n6. Tissues\n7. Diversity in Living Organisms\n8. Motion\n9. Force and Laws of Motion\n10. Gravitation\n11. Work and Energy\n12. Sound\n13. Why Do We Fall Ill\n14. Natural Resources\n15. Improvements in Food Resources\n\nOver the next few months we will continue to add new features and subjects to MarkSharks so that students not only can learn on their own, at their own pace and in their own time, but can also share their learnings with friends via our “social learning” environment and access to tutors online to help clear problems. Parents will get online access to track their child s performance on MarkSharks and compare it with other students who are studying on the system.\n\nClass nine is a stressful time in a student s life. A lot of students will be sitting for the board exams in a year and have to learn how to study effectively in order to be able to go over all the science 9th content. MarkSharks Science for class 9 teaches students to go through the ncert science class IX textbook in a way that helps them not only memorise concepts but also understand them. With chapters like gravitation (physics class 9), tissues(biology class 9) and atoms and molecules (chemistry class 9) coming their way students must take time to learn the concepts and not just facts if they want to ace their std 9 science exams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'https://apkpure.com/class-9-science-by-marksharks/com.oksedu.marksharks.cbse.g09.s02/download?from=home', '1.0.0.16', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VMM2QKgHuthatHyzhTXZhQcTxnQMgetxEXOws-6IBaf5B2TdPA1Y26tWaR_60d1K6Mg=w72', 0, 4, 913, 10, '2017-01-30 10:17:43', 'com.oksedu.marksharks.cbse.g09.s02', 0),

Gross anatomy (also called topographical anatomy, regional anatomy, or anthropotomy) is the study of anatomical structures that can be seen by the naked eye. Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures assisted with microscopes, which includes histology (the study of the organization of tissues), and cytology (the study of cells). Anatomy, human physiology (the study of function), and biochemistry (the study of the chemistry of living structures) are complementary basic medical sciences that are generally together (or in tandem) to students studying medical sciences. Generally, physicians, dentists, physiotherapists, nurses, paramedics, radiographers, and students of certain biological sciences, learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures, and tutorials. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope; and in addition, medical and dental students generally also learn anatomy with practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers (dead human bodies). A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required for all medical doctors, especially surgeons, and doctors working in some diagnostic specialities, such as histopathology and radiology.\nHuman anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry are basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray s Anatomy, has recently been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching.\n\n\nHere we shall cover some part of human anatomy, which can be used by the user as a quick reference whenever he/she requires.\n\nGo through the application and do help us with your honest Ratings.\n\nWe have partnered with AppLovin Corporation to bring you a more social experience including but not limited to tools that allow you to: more easily invite your friends to your app, receive alerts from your friends, and receive social advertising.

The list was first prepared in 1936. Though Dr. Dolch compiled the list based on children s books of his era. The list contains 220 "service words" that have to be easily recognized in order to achieve reading fluency in the English language. The original word list excludes nouns, which comprise a separate 95-word noun list. The game is designed to make children smart thinking and can recognize sounds, putting letters together words into syllables to make the children think logically to identify the structure of different English words. \n\nMany of the original 220 Dolch words cannot be learned by pictures or "sounded out" using common sound/letter phonics patterns and have to be learned by sight; hence the term, "sight words." The original Dolch words which compromise of 220 words and the additional 95 nouns is usually divided into grades, though for native English speakers, all the Dolch Sight Words should be learned before elementary education begins. \n\nThe app now gives an option to learn sight words for Preschool, Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 and Nouns. \n\nInstructions: \nDrag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the sound in each mode. \n\nEasy Mode: \nChild needs to drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the word. \n\nNormal Mode: \nChild needs to drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the sound. \n\nFeatures: \n* A simple and easy to understand game. \n* 2 different modes of spelling game. \n* The child can also listen to sight words to improve his/her learning process while playing. The background can be muted to hear the sounds clearly. \n* The child can play in either  Play Mode . \n* Supports all screen sizes. \nAnd last but not least ***All words are available for FREE*** \nPrivacy Disclosure:? \nAs parents ourselves, EDUBUZZKIDS takes children s wellness and privacy very seriously.

In Kids Learn to Read Rhymes, kids will learn word families, CVC, short and long vowel words through three wonderful games. Kids Learn to Read Rhymes is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to blend sounds into words, read and form simple words, identify spoken words and learn word families. Rhyming is a precursor to learning how to read and write. With a successful completion of each level in Kids Learn to Read Rhymes, kids will have a strong sense of phonemic awareness and a solid groundwork for written language. It s rhyme time! \n\nKids love to rhyme words. Kids who read English nursery rhymes will love these rhyming games and they will learn new rhymes that will help them in reading English, especially the nursery rhymes. Let the kids pick & click or catch the match in 3 wonderful rhyming games, which covers 39 word families through more than 225 rhyming words and pictures. \n\nWord Families: \nIt enchants learning through selecting a vowel and a word family, then its time to match the pictures or objects to the words. It promotes object identification, increases vocabulary, reading skills and interactively enhances proper pronunciation. \n\nPick & Click: \nIt is the most thought provoking activity, as the kids are asked to match the pictures of rhyming words. This game acts as a reinforcement of the  word families  in an engaging and intuitive manner peaking your child s curiosity. \n\nCatch the Match: \nBud is set out on an adventure to explore the ocean bed in search of the rhyming words. Meet the fishes and Octopus but beware of the wrong words. \nDo not forget to try your best and receive the much deserved positive responses from a job well done (Thumbs Up!) \n\nAfter Words for Kids, this is the latest addition in our series of Early Language Development apps for kids. Download these apps and help your children pick key concepts of English from a very early age. \n\nHow will it benefit kids? \n\n- Develops phonemic awareness \n- Enriches vocabulary \n- Helps progress with reading \n- Develops literary skills \n- Teaches recognition of word patterns \n- Teaches recognition of letter and word sounds \n- Motivates learning and above all \n- Makes English learning easy and fun! \n\nOther key points: \n\n- Ideal for children between the ages of 4-9. \n- Activities in this game are aligned with the Common Core State Standards \n- Suitable for both school and home setting \n- Great tool for children with learning difficulties such as speech delay, autism and adhd. - Perfect for ESL learners as well. \n\nPrivacy Policy: \n\nPrivacy is an issue that we take seriously.

Use OneNote s flexible canvas to place content anywhere you want. You can even scan hand written notes or pages straight into OneNote then make them searchable. \n\nGET ORGANIZED\nOneNote is set up like a notebook to bring the familiar physical 3-ring binder to the digital era. Easily use sections and pages to separate out thoughts by theme at school, home or work. Not sure where you categorized something? Use our powerful search to look across all of your notebooks or just the page you re on to find what you re looking for, even words on pages you scanned into your notes. You can use tags to label to-do lists, follow up items, mark what s important or make custom labels. Use OneNote as a notebook, journal or a notepad. Organize in one place, from anyplace. \n\nCOLLABORATE WITH ANYONE\nShare your notebook with whomever you want, such as your colleagues or family, and work on your projects together. OneNote syncs your notes across all devices and lets multiple people work on the content together, at the same time. Leave comments or tags to people to ask follow up questions, draw up your ideas, plan and journal the family vacation or check off the to-do list. \n\nACCOMPLISH MORE AT WORK\nOneNote is great on your own or when you share with a team. Use it as a notepad for team meetings, brainstorming projects, draw attention to important points or organize key resources to never lose track of what you need. Work together in real time to stay in sync and on the same page. You can log in with 2 accounts at the same time to seamlessly move from work to personal and back. OneNote is available across your favorite devices, no matter what your team likes to use --Android, Apple or Windows-- you can still work together to get more done. \n\nACHIEVE MORE IN SCHOOL\nOneNote is great for school for both students and teachers. Take your notes during class with ease, mixing in text, ink, and web clippings. Use OneNote to organize your brainstorms, draw mind maps and develop your ideas for your next school assignment. As a teacher, plan your lessons and have all the information you need right in your pocket and on the go. \n\nBETTER TOGETHER WITH OFFICE\nOneNote is part of the Office family and works great with your favorite apps, such as Excel or Word to help you do more. \n\nNOTES AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT\nUse the OneNote badge as a notepad to list your thoughts down no matter when something crosses your mind. The badge hovers on screen and lets you quickly write your thoughts down during a phone call, while on the web or wherever else your mind takes you. In addition to the badge you can launch OneNote from a home screen widget or pin a notebook or page straight to the home screen helping you dive in faster, right where you want. \n\nYou can find answers to Frequently Asked Questions about OneNote for Android at http://aka.ms/OnenoteAndroidFAQ  \n\nRequirements:  \n• Requires Android OS 4.1 or later.  \n• A free Microsoft account is required to use OneNote.  \n• OneNote opens existing notebooks created in Microsoft OneNote 2010 format or later. \n• To sync your notes to OneDrive for Business, sign in with your organization s Office 365 or SharePoint account. \nLike us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, or visit the blog for the latest news:  \nhttp://facebook.com/MicrosoftOneNote \nhttps://twitter.com/msonenote \nhttps://plus.google.com/102199506601015331367/ \nhttp://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-onenote \nhttp://OneNote.com \nhttps://plus.google.com/communities/113633281646135322395/ ', 'https://apkpure.com/one-note/com.microsoft.office.onenote/download?from=home', 'Varies with device', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bUOH_L5Y4KHh5dDgyIRtbKvyeUyuj0PrXOMcGkSM9rlJdOJhcmVcFZk5SMnTHD37WQ=w72', 0, 4, 193203, 100, '2017-02-04 11:25:16', 'com.microsoft.office.onenote', 0),
